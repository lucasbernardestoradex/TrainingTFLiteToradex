# Train a custom object detection, including Toradex modules, with TensorFlow Lite Model Maker

In this project, you will learn how to use the **TensorFlow Lite Model Maker** to train a custom object detection model to detect Toradex modules and other basic objects.

The Model Maker library uses *transfer learning* to simpliify the training process of a TensorFlow Lite model using a custom dataset. Retraining a TensorFlow Lite model with your own custom dataset reduces the amount of training data required and will shorten the training time.
